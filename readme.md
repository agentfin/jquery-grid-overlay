<h1>jQuery 960 Grid Overlay</h1>

<p>For most projects I use the <a href="http://960.gs" alt="960 Grid System">960 Grid System</a> and in doing so I built a plugin to overlay the grid to make sure my work was in alignment. After showing others my plugin I have been asked to share it, thus the jQuery 960 Grid Overlay was born.</p>

<p>The plugin takes the popular 960 Grid System structure and overlays it on the top of a website upon pressing the escape key. Simple enough.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jquery.com/" alt="jQuery">jQuery</a></li>
  <li>A bit of HTML, CSS, &amp; JavaScript</li>
  <li>An image of your desired grid (960 grid included)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Getting Started</h1>

<p>Open the index.html file included here and copy everything between the <code>body</code> tags into the header of your document. For best results place it directly below your opening <code>body</code> tag. Within this code be sure to update the CSS background to reference your specific grid. Grids included are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>12 Column &mdash; <code>images/grid_12_col.png</code></li>
    <li>16 Column &mdash; <code>images/grid_16_col.png</code></li>
    <li>24 Column &mdash; <code>images/grid_24_col.png</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Also included is a PSD file that will allow you to create your own grids.</p>

<p>Once all of the code and files are in place open up the browser and press the escape key, your grid should appear.</p>

<h1>Additional Notes</h1>

<ul>
    <li>All of the grid images include use a 20 pixel baseline grid to accompany the 960 vertical grid.</li>
